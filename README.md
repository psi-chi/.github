# Default Community Health Files

This repository includes all the necessary [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file). Default files are used for any repository owned by the account that does not contain its own file of that type.
