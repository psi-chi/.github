# Contributing Guide

First off, thank you for considering contributing. It's people like you that make open-source projects possible.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing an open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Responsibilities

- Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this [checklist](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

- A `good first issue` issue will only require a few lines of code and a test or two.
- A `help wanted` issue will be more involved than beginner issues.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed and that you need to update your branch, so it's easier to merge.

## Getting Started

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase ([Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). Please follow the following steps to start contributing:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `lab`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request to the `lab` branch.

The `lab` branch will be used for testing the code for a few days before merging with the `main` branch.

## Commit Message Conventions

While committing, make sure to follow these guidelines:

- Capitalize only the first alphabet of the commit.
- Start the commit with `Add` for new features, `Change` for changes in existing functionality, `Remove` for now removed features, and `Fix` for any bug fixes.
- If necessary, add a brief description.
